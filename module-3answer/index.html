			Cinnamon roll
		</div>
		<p>
			A cinnamon bun (also cinnamon roll, cinnamon swirl, cinnamon Danish, and cinnamon snail) is a sweet roll served commonly in Northern Europe and North America. In Denmark, it is known as Kanelsnegl; 'cinnamon snail and is a form of wienerbrød ('Vienna Bread'). In North America, it is commonly eaten for breakfast or dessert. Its main ingredients are flour, cinnamon, sugar, and butter, which provide a robust and sweet flavor. In some places, it is eaten as a breakfast food and is served with cream cheese or icing.

		<div id="beef">Fried ice cream</div>
		<p>Fried ice cream is a dessert made from a breaded scoop of ice cream that is quickly deep-fried creating a warm, crispy shell around the still-cold ice cream. There are conflicting stories about the dessert's origin. Some claim that it was first served during the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, where the ice cream sundae was also invented. Though in 1894, a Philadelphia company was given credit for its invention describing: "A small, solid [cake] of the ice cream is enveloped in a thin sheet of pie crust and then dipped into boiling lard or butter to cook the outside to a crisp. Served immediately, the ice cream is found to be as solidly frozen as it was first prepared." A third claim, beginning in the 1960s proposes that fried ice cream was invented by Japanese tempura restaurants. In the late 1960s, critic Cooper Adams refused to believe in the dish’s existence until the moment it was placed in front of him. In the United States, fried ice cream has been associated with Asian cuisine, appearing in reviews of Chinese, Japanese, and Polynesian restaurants in the "Dining Out" section of the New York Times in the 1970s. It also came to be associated with Mexican cuisine, in large part due to national chain Chi-Chi's adopting a fried ice cream made with tortillas and cinnamon as its "signature dessert" when it opened in the early 1980s. The connection with Asian cuisine is also reflected in Australia.

		<div id="sushi">Chocolate brownie</div>
		<p>A chocolate brownie (commonly referred to as simply brownie) is a square, baked, chocolate dessert. Brownies come in a variety of forms and may be either fudgy or cakey, depending on their density. They may include nuts, frosting, cream cheese, chocolate chips, or other ingredients. A variation made with vanilla rather than chocolate in the batter is called a blonde brownie or blondie. The brownie was developed in the United States at the end of the 19th century and popularized in the U.S. and Canada during the first half of the 20th century. Brownies are typically eaten by hand, often accompanied by milk, served warm with ice cream (a la mode), topped with whipped cream, or sprinkled with powdered sugar and fudge. In North America they are common lunchbox treats,[citation needed] and also popular in restaurants and coffeehouses.
